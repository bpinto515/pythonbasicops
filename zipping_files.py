## BASIC SCRIPT TO BACKUP FILES TO ZIP

    folder = os.path.abspath(folder)

    # determine filename to backup to
    ver = 1

            break
        ver += 1
    
    # create the zip file
    print("\narchiving %s..." % (zip_filename))
    backup_zip_file = zipfile.ZipFile(zip_filename, 'w')

    # walk the folder tree in it's entirety to compress all files in subfolders as well
    # during each iteration of the for loop os.walk returns the current folder name,
    # subfolders in that folder, as well as all the filenames within that folder
    for foldername, subfolders, filenames in os.walk(folder):
        print("\nadding files in %s..." % (foldername))
        backup_zip_file.write(foldername)

            if filename.startswith(new_base) and filename.endswith('.zip'):
                continue # we don't want to back up zip files
            backup_zip_file.write(os.path.join(foldername, filename))
